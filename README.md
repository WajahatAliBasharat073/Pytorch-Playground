# PyTorch Projects Repository

A collection of machine learning projects implemented using PyTorch, covering various domains and applications in deep learning and data science.

## 📋 Repository Overview

This repository contains multiple PyTorch-based projects, each focusing on different machine learning tasks and datasets. Each project is self-contained with its own implementation, documentation, and results.

## 🚀 Projects

### Project 1: Rice Type Classification
**Location**: `Project1/`

A binary classification project for identifying different types of rice based on morphological characteristics extracted from rice grain images.

#### Key Features:
- **Dataset**: Rice grain morphological measurements (18,185 samples)
- **Task**: Binary classification (2 rice types)
- **Model**: Neural network with PyTorch
- **Features**: Area, axis lengths, eccentricity, convex area, perimeter, roundness, etc.

#### Dataset Features:
- **Area**: Total area of the rice grain
- **MajorAxisLength**: Length of the major axis
- **MinorAxisLength**: Length of the minor axis
- **Eccentricity**: Measure of how much the grain deviates from being circular
- **ConvexArea**: Area of the convex hull
- **EquivDiameter**: Diameter of a circle with the same area
- **Extent**: Ratio of the grain area to the bounding box area
- **Perimeter**: Perimeter of the rice grain
- **Roundness**: Measure of how round the grain is
- **AspectRatio**: Ratio of major axis to minor axis
- **Class**: Target variable (rice type)

#### Files:
- `TabularDataClassification.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- Dataset: `Datasets/riceClassification.csv`

#### Usage:
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd Project1/

# Start Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook TabularDataClassification.ipynb
```
