# Rice Type Classification Project

A binary classification project for identifying different types of rice based on morphological characteristics extracted from rice grain images using PyTorch.

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a neural network classifier to distinguish between two types of rice based on morphological features extracted from rice grain images. The model analyzes various geometric and shape characteristics to accurately classify rice types.

### Dataset Information
- **Source**: Rice grain morphological measurements dataset
- **Samples**: 18,185 rice grain samples
- **Classes**: 2 rice types (binary classification)
- **Features**: 11 morphological characteristics

### Key Features
- **Area**: Total area of the rice grain
- **MajorAxisLength**: Length of the major axis
- **MinorAxisLength**: Length of the minor axis
- **Eccentricity**: Measure of how much the grain deviates from being circular
- **ConvexArea**: Area of the convex hull
- **EquivDiameter**: Diameter of a circle with the same area
- **Extent**: Ratio of the grain area to the bounding box area
- **Perimeter**: Perimeter of the rice grain
- **Roundness**: Measure of how round the grain is
- **AspectRatio**: Ratio of major axis to minor axis
- **Class**: Target variable (rice type)
